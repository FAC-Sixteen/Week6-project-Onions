#### "Let's not count our chickens before they hatch." - Joko

* spelling 'table' and 'opinion'
    * I have an opintion.
* naming functions --> 'action' to action **and** table --> action vs actionList --> input and inputRow
* using fetch! so much easier than xhr requests!
* things take time!

### CI
* travis caught all our jshint issues that prevented travis from passing the test checks
