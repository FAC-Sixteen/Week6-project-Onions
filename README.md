## Process

### Day 1
* brainstormed ideas

* drew out file structure and user journey

## 💡 Problems/What we learnt
#### "Let's not count our chickens before they hatch." - Joko

* spelling 'table' and 'opinion'
    * I have an opintion.
* naming functions --> 'action' to action **and** table --> action vs actionList --> input and inputRow
* using fetch! so much easier than xhr requests!
